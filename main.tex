\begin{abstract}
    
    The Spotted Lanternfly is an invasive species from Asia which has recently been introduced to the Northeast United States.  It is thought that its introduction could spell disaster for the grape and stone fruit industries in Pennsylvania \cite{news-flies}.  
    
    To better understand the problem at hand, this paper will examine a model for the spread of an invasive species.  In particular it will look at the effect of factors such as predation, food supplies, and others to determine the effects these have on the diffusion of the species into the surrounding environment.
